**Development of the affect dynamics model in the Brazilian context**
---


This code was developed to calculate the affect dynamics model. Unlike other open source code, this code is designed to:

1. Calculate the adjusted L metric;
2. Apply a t-test to calculate the statistical significance of the results considering all students;
3. Apply the p-value adjustment calculation for multiple tests, considering the Benjamini/Hochberg (BH) method;
4. Print calculated statistics in tabular form;
5. Automatically render affect dynamics graphical model based on calculated statistics, considering only transitions reported as significant after p-value adjustment based on BH method;
6. Calculate affect dynamics general model considering all the students;
7. Calculate models of affect dynamics considering the students' gender;
8. Develop the affect dynamics model according to the time spent in each emotion
